# GameTrial
This dynamic library management system is for a fictional video game rental company. The website uses Node, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize to interface with a SQLite database containing games, customers, and rentals. Select and update functionality is integrated into the UI.

## How to Use

## Programming
Due to Heroku not supporting SQLite, the demo above has its tables reset every few hours. In the near future I will be converting from SQLite to PostgreSQL to remedy this, in addition to adding new functionality.
